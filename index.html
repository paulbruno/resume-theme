      <p class="summary">
        I want to build effective, even elegant software — well-built systems down to the bones
        — and be an instrument of good, without (taking part in the company and its mission) as
        well as within (inside the org as a leader wherever I should find myself).

        Veteran web software engineer (<strong>12+ yrs.</strong>, incl.
        <strong>7+ yrs. remote</strong>); the weight of these years
        counterbalanced by a curiosity and tenacity that have never left him.
        Champion of elegant yet pragmatic engineering solutions (whatever the
        tech stack) and cohesive, well-oiled, tight-knit engineering teams.
        Adept in serving and shepherding new projects and mature software
        ecosystems, aiming his gusto at trail-blazing and bug-fixing alike.
